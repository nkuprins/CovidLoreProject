Is this out of line with current consensus? 
I feel like I’ve been seeing a lot of ~4 day incubation assertions for Delta 
and thought the original variety was more like ~5.5 on average.

EDIT: I am referring to the time between initial exposure/infection and becoming symptomatic. 
I believe this is the “incubation period.” I had seen reports of Delta being 4ish days, often even closer to 2 or 3. 
This is saying 5.8 days.');

'Researchers in South Africa are racing to track the concerning rise of a new variant of 
the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The variant harbours a large number of mutations found 
in other variants, including Delta, and it seems to be spreading quickly across South Africa.

A top priority is to track the variant more closely as it spreads: it was first identified in Botswana 
this month and has turned up in travellers to Hong Kong from South Africa. Scientists are also trying 
to understand the variant’s properties, such as whether it can evade immune responses triggered by vaccines 
and whether it causes more or less severe disease than other variants do.');
